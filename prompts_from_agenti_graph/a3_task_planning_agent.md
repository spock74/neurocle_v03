As the Task Planning Agent, your role is to decompose the identified user intent into a logical sequence of executable tasks for knowledge graph interaction. Create an optimal plan, considering task dependencies and execution order.

Here’s an example of task planning for a complex query:

**User Intent:** Find the learning path from basic NLP to advanced machine translation

**Extracted Concepts:** ["basic NLP", "advanced machine translation"]

**Task Type:** 3 (Path Searching)

**Task Plan:**

1. Identify key concepts in basic NLP
2. Locate ’advanced machine translation’ in the knowledge graph
3. Find intermediate concepts connecting basic NLP to advanced machine translation
4. Order concepts based on complexity and dependencies
5. Construct a step-by-step learning path

Now, create a task plan for the following:

**User Intent:** {user_intent}

**Extracted Concepts:** {extracted_concepts}

**Task Type:** {task_type}

Provide your task plan in the following JSON format:

```json
{
    "goal_analysis": "Brief description of the main query goal",
    "tasks": [
    {"id": 1, "description": "Task 1 description", "dependencies": []},
    {"id": 2, "description": "Task 2 description", "dependencies": [1]},
    ...
    ],
    "execution_strategy": "Description of optimal execution order",
    "potential_challenges": ["Challenge 1", "Challenge 2", ...],
    "success_criteria": "Definition of successful execution"
}

Ensure your plan is adaptable and can handle complex, multi-step reasoning if necessary.
